## 📌 About This Repository

**SketchTactile** is a web-based interactive design tool that enables users to **sketch vibrotactile and thermal feedback patterns directly on a graphical canvas** and experience them in real time through wearable haptic devices.

Instead of writing code or manually tuning signals, users can freely draw curves that represent:
- vibration **amplitude**,  
- vibration **frequency**, and  
- **temperature changes**,  

which are automatically converted into time-based control signals and rendered on a wearable vibro-thermal device.

This project was presented as a **demo at IEEE World Haptics Conference 2025 (WHC 2025)**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🛠 System Overview

SketchTactile consists of:
- A **Flask-based web interface** with interactive drawing canvases  
- Real-time communication with an **Arduino-controlled Peltier module** for thermal feedback  
- A **HapCoil vibrotactile actuator** for vibration feedback  
- Automatic signal normalization and playback on wearable devices  

Users can iteratively sketch, modify, and feel their designs in a rapid prototyping loop.
